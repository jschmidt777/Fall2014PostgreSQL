Database Management

This contains my final project for Database management. It is a 3NF database system built with the SQL language PostgreSQL that would be used by an ROTC unit at the company size (usually how big a college ROTC program is). The idea is that this would be used for management of property, awards, PT scores, trainings, and other related information that would be worth tracking. A future version of this system would include other procedureal functions to handle some changes automatically.
